# Scope

This document contains requirements and provide usage examples for the OCP Baseline Hardware Management API v1.1.
The baseline hardware management tasks are a common set of manageability from which OCP platforms can extend.

# Requirements

As a Redfish-based interface, the required Redfish interface model elements are specified in a corresponding profile document.
For the Baseline Hardware Management API v1.1 [4].

## Validating conformance

The profile file can be read by the open-source conformance test, Redfish Interop Validator [3].
The validator will auto-generate tests, execute the tests against an implementation, and create a test report.

The following command executes the validator.

	$> python RedfishInteropValidator.py <profileName> \--ip <host:port>
