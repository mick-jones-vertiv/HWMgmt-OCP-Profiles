# OCP-Profiles
This repository contains OCP Profiles.

OCP has designation the Redfish standard for the out-of-band manageability interface for OCP platforms. The Redfish standard is development by [DMTF Redfish Forum](http://dmtf.org/redfish) and their alliance partners.

A profile is a JSON document which prescribes a subset of Redfish resource and resource properties required be supported by an implementation.  The profile can be read by the [Redfish Interop Validator](https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Interop-Validator), which will test a implementation for conformance to the profile.

The format of the profile file is specified by the [Redfish Interoperability Profile Specification](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0272_1.4.0.pdf)

The profiles present at the root of the repository have been approved by OCP. Each approved profile is associated to a corresponding Usage Guide, which can be found in the [OCP Contribution database](https://www.opencompute.org/contributions). Search for "Usage'.

The profiles present in the subfolders are still being developed by the associated project. See the pull requests for the associated development.
